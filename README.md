## [WIP] React Native Easy Library

**Experience the power of beeing native**

Template shows minimal monorepo setup designed to generate React Native libraries with codegen support.

By leveraging this setup, you can significantly reduce development time as it automates the upgrade process. For more in-depth instructions, please refer to the `examples` folder.

You can dive straight into developing your native library using `Swift` and `Kotlin` without worrying about the configuration.

Repo provides a minimal setup for one synchronous function and one asynchronous function, allowing you to quickly get started on building your library.
